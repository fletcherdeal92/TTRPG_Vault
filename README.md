# Written in Water — Elias Campaign (Obsidian + VS Code)

This is an Obsidian vault wired for an **Old Gods of Appalachia x Tallulah Falls** campaign, driven from VS Code with an agent (Continue, Cline, or Aider).  
Stick to the provided templates and guidelines to keep things consistent.

## Structure
- `00_System/` – guidelines, session runner, templates
- `10_Lore/` – cosmology, factions, myths, timelines
- `20_Locations/` – places, maps, keyed areas
- `30_NPCs/` – people, creatures, entities
- `40_Items_Cyphers/` – gear, artifacts, cyphers, tags
- `50_Sessions/` – session notes, logs, recaps
- `60_Rules_OGoA/` – rules excerpts you paste in for reference
- `assets/` – images, handouts, maps

Use YAML frontmatter on every note; Dataview-friendly fields are prefilled in templates.
