## Core Mechanics
**Difficulty Ladder & Target Numbers**  
- Difficulty 1 → TN 3  
- Difficulty 2 → TN 6  
- Difficulty 3 → TN 9  
- Difficulty 4 → TN 12  
- Difficulty 5 → TN 15  
- Difficulty 6 → TN 18  
- Difficulty 7 → TN 21  
- Difficulty 8 → TN 24  
- Difficulty 9 → TN 27  
- Difficulty 10 → TN 30  

**Task Steps**  
1. GM sets difficulty (1–10).  
2. Apply skills/assets (max 2 assets).  
3. Apply Effort (costs points from a relevant stat pool, reduced by Edge).  
4. Roll d20 → success if result meets/exceeds Target Number.  

**GM Intrusions**  
- Introduce complication/twist without a roll.  
- Award: 2 XP (1 to player, 1 to give another).  
- Player can refuse by spending 1 XP.

## Resources & Recovery
**Stat Pools & Edge**  
- Three pools: Might, Speed, Intellect.  
- Edge reduces pool point cost for Effort and special abilities.

**Damage Track**  
- **Hale** → one pool at 0 → **Impaired** → two pools at 0 → **Debilitated** → three pools at 0 = dead.  
- Impaired: roll max TN 17, Effort costs +1.

**Armor Rules**  
- Armor reduces damage by its rating from relevant sources.  
- Max armor from sources usually capped (unless special ability).

**Recovery Rolls**  
- 1st recovery: 1d6 + Tier minutes.  
- 2nd: 1d6 + Tier hours.  
- 3rd: 1d6 + Tier 10 hours.  
- 4th: 1d6 + Tier 24 hours.

## Old Gods of Appalachia Specific
**Affinity & Appalachian Weirdness**  
- Affinity: supernatural tie; grants thematic abilities.  
- Weirdness: minor supernatural quirk; mostly flavor but can have mechanical edge or drawback.

**Cyphers**  
- **Tier-based Limits (total, any mix of manifest/subtle):**  
  - Tier 1 → **2**  
  - Tier 2 → **3**  
  - Tier 3 → **4**  
  - Tier 4 → **5**  
  - Tier 5 → **6**  
  - Tier 6 → **7**  
  If acquiring one beyond your limit, discard or use one to make space.
- **Identifying a Cypher:** Intellect task; difficulty set by the GM based on complexity/strangeness.  
- **Using a Cypher:** Single-use; most are expended/destroyed on activation (some persist briefly per description).  
- **Types:**  
  - **Manifest:** Tangible items (charms, potions, relics, tools).  
  - **Subtle:** Intangible effects (mental boosts, protective auras, sensory enhancements).  
- **Selection:** GM rolls or chooses from OGoA cypher tables; reskinning to Appalachian horror is encouraged.  
- **Design Note:** Cyphers are intentionally powerful to encourage use, not hoarding.

**Campaign Examples (Reskinned, rules-aligned):**  
- **Silver Tongue Brooch** *(subtle; reskin of an Influence-style cypher)* — Eases one persuasion or deception interaction by **2 steps**; single use.  
- **Traveler’s Charm** *(subtle; reskin of a Pathfinder/navigation cypher)* — Grants **one automatic success** on a navigation/orientation/tracking task within 24 hours; single use.

**Horror/Weird Elements**  
- Use GM Intrusions to escalate dread or reveal hidden truths.  
- Clocks/timers represent looming threats or supernatural awakenings.
