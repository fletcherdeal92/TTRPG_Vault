## Core Mechanics
**Difficulty Ladder & Target Numbers**  
- Difficulty 1 → TN 3  
- Difficulty 2 → TN 6  
- Difficulty 3 → TN 9  
- Difficulty 4 → TN 12  
- Difficulty 5 → TN 15  
- Difficulty 6 → TN 18  
- Difficulty 7 → TN 21  
- Difficulty 8 → TN 24  
- Difficulty 9 → TN 27  
- Difficulty 10 → TN 30  

**Task Steps**  
1. GM sets difficulty (1–10).  
2. Apply skills/assets (max 2 assets).  
3. Apply Effort (costs points from a relevant stat pool, reduced by Edge).  
4. Roll d20 → success if result meets/exceeds Target Number.  

**GM Intrusions**  
- Introduce complication/twist without a roll.  
- Award: 2 XP (1 to player, 1 to give another).  
- Player can refuse by spending 1 XP.

## Resources & Recovery
**Stat Pools & Edge**  
- Three pools: Might, Speed, Intellect.  
- Edge reduces pool point cost for Effort and special abilities.

**Damage Track**  
- **Hale** → one pool at 0 → **Impaired** → two pools at 0 → **Debilitated** → three pools at 0 = dead.  
- Impaired: roll max TN 17, Effort costs +1.

**Armor Rules**  
- Armor reduces damage by its rating from relevant sources.  
- Max armor from sources usually capped (unless special ability).

**Recovery Rolls**  
- 1st recovery: 1d6 + Tier minutes.  
- 2nd: 1d6 + Tier hours.  
- 3rd: 1d6 + Tier 10 hours.  
- 4th: 1d6 + Tier 24 hours.

## Old Gods of Appalachia Specific
**Affinity & Appalachian Weirdness**  
- Affinity: supernatural tie; grants thematic abilities.  
- Weirdness: minor supernatural quirk; mostly flavor but can have mechanical edge or drawback.

**Cyphers**  
- Limit: two *manifest* (physical) or three *subtle* (mental/spiritual) at a time.  
- Identify with Intellect task; TN varies.  
- Using a cypher usually destroys it.

**Horror/Weird Elements**  
- Use GM Intrusions to escalate dread or reveal hidden truths.  
- Clocks/timers represent looming threats or supernatural awakenings.
