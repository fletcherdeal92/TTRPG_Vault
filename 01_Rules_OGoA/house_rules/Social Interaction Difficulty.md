# Social Interaction Difficulty

Modified social interaction rules for 1920s Appalachian mountain communities where locals are naturally wary of outsiders and protective of community secrets.

## Rule Summary
**Quick reference:** Base difficulty for getting information from locals is increased due to cultural wariness, but can be reduced through trust-building and proper approach.

## Detailed Explanation
### When This Rule Applies
- Characters are interacting with local mountain residents
- Characters are seeking information about local secrets, supernatural events, or community business
- Characters are clearly identified as outsiders (city folk, academics, government agents, etc.)
- NPCs are being asked about sensitive topics (family business, strange occurrences, local tragedies)

### How It Works
1. Determine base difficulty for information requested (GM discretion based on sensitivity)
2. Apply +1 difficulty penalty for being outsiders
3. Check for trust-building factors that may reduce difficulty
4. Factor in approach method and cultural sensitivity
5. Roll modified social interaction task

### Examples
**Example 1:**
- **Situation:** Characters asking depot master about local "strange happenings"
- **Application:** Base difficulty 4 (moderately sensitive), +1 for outsiders = Difficulty 5
- **Outcome:** Character mentions connection to Professor (trusted figure), reduces to Difficulty 4

**Example 2:**
- **Situation:** Characters asking about specific missing persons or family tragedies
- **Application:** Base difficulty 6 (very sensitive), +1 for outsiders = Difficulty 7
- **Outcome:** Character offers to help rather than just ask questions, reduces to Difficulty 6

## Old Gods of Appalachia Integration
### Setting-Specific Applications
- **Mountain folklore:** Locals are protective of supernatural knowledge that keeps community safe
- **Supernatural encounters:** People who've experienced supernatural events are often traumatized and reluctant to discuss
- **1920s technology limitations:** No mass communication means communities are more insular
- **Community dynamics:** Family reputation and community standing affect willingness to share information

### Atmospheric Considerations
- **Building tension:** Initial wariness creates atmosphere of secrets and hidden dangers
- **Maintaining mystery:** Even helpful NPCs may withhold crucial details to protect characters
- **Cultural authenticity:** Reflects real Appalachian cultural values of privacy and self-reliance

## Mechanical Details

### Cypher System Integration
- **Difficulty modifications:** 
  - Standard information request: +1 difficulty
  - Sensitive family/personal topics: +2 difficulty
  - Supernatural/dangerous topics: +1 difficulty (locals want to protect you)
  - Government/legal topics: +2 difficulty (historical wariness)
- **Asset/hindrance rules:** 
  - Personal connections provide Asset
  - Rude or pushy behavior provides Hindrance
  - Helping community members provides Asset for future interactions
- **GM intrusion opportunities:** Suspicious locals spread word about nosy outsiders
- **Edge cases:** Characters with local family connections or mountain backgrounds get reduced penalties

### Related Rules
- **Trust Building Mechanics:** Repeated positive interactions reduce outsider penalty over time

### Conflicts & Clarifications
- **Overrides:** This modifies standard Cypher social interaction rules in mountain community settings
- **Exceptions:** Emergency situations may temporarily reduce wariness
- **Edge cases:** Children and elderly may be more or less talkative depending on individual personality
- **GM discretion points:** Cultural sensitivity in character approach can modify difficulties significantly

## Session Applications
### Quick Reference Table
| Information Type | Base Difficulty | Outsider Penalty | Modified Difficulty |
|-----------------|----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| General directions/services | 2 | +1 | 3 |
| Local history/folklore | 4 | +1 | 5 |
| Recent strange events | 5 | +1 | 6 |
| Personal/family matters | 6 | +2 | 8 |
| Government/legal issues | 5 | +2 | 7 |

### GM Tools
- **When to apply:** Any social interaction with established local community members
- **When to ignore:** Interactions with other outsiders or in non-mountain community settings
- **Scaling for drama:** Increase penalties when locals are actively trying to protect dangerous secrets
- **Player agency considerations:** Give clear feedback about cultural missteps and successful approaches

## Common Mistakes
### Player Misunderstandings
- **Common error:** Assuming money or authority will overcome cultural barriers
  **Correction:** Mountain communities value respect and genuine need over wealth or status

- **Common error:** Pushing harder when initial attempts fail
  **Correction:** Persistence often backfires; better to build trust over time or find different approaches

### GM Pitfalls
- **Avoid:** Making all locals equally unhelpful or hostile
  **Instead:** Vary individual personalities while maintaining cultural patterns

- **Avoid:** Punishing players for not knowing specific cultural details
  **Instead:** Let character actions and attitudes matter more than player knowledge

## Playtesting Notes
### What Works Well
- Creates authentic sense of being outsiders in tight-knit community
- Encourages players to think about approach and relationship building
- Supports atmosphere of secrets and hidden knowledge

### What Needs Adjustment
- Balance between realistic wariness and game flow
- Ensure some NPCs are accessible to prevent total information shutdown
- Monitor cumulative effect on investigation progress

### Player Feedback
- Players enjoy the challenge of earning trust and respect
- Atmospheric element adds to rural horror setting
- Need clear signals about what approaches work vs. backfire

## Designer Notes

### Balance Considerations
