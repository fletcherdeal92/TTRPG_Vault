# Old Gods Whispers

Characters in areas of strong Old Gods influence may hear whispers, voices, or sounds that provide information - but at a psychological cost.

## Rule Summary
**Quick reference:** In supernatural locations, characters may attempt to "listen" to Old Gods whispers for information, but suffer mental stress.

## Detailed Explanation
### When This Rule Applies
- Characters are in locations with "moderate" or higher Old Gods influence
- Characters are actively investigating supernatural phenomena
- Characters possess items connected to Old Gods (artifacts, cursed objects)
- During moments of high tension or when supernatural entities are active

### How It Works
1. GM describes ambient supernatural "presence" in the area
2. Player declares character is deliberately opening themselves to Old Gods influence
3. Character makes Intellect task (difficulty varies by location and circumstances)
4. Success provides useful information but inflicts mental stress
5. Failure provides false or dangerous information and greater mental stress

### Examples
**Example 1:**
- **Situation:** Character investigating Panther Creek, area of strong Old Gods influence
- **Application:** Player declares character is "listening" to forest sounds for clues
- **Outcome:** Difficulty 5 Intellect task. Success: learns location of hidden cave entrance. Cost: 2 points Intellect damage from psychic intrusion.

**Example 2:**
- **Situation:** Character holding Strange Geological Samples while exploring
- **Application:** Samples begin humming, character focuses on the sound
- **Outcome:** Difficulty 4 Intellect task. Failure: believes samples are leading toward safety, but actually toward dangerous entity. Cost: 3 points Intellect damage.

## Old Gods of Appalachia Integration
### Setting-Specific Applications
- **Mountain folklore:** Whispers often mimic voices of missing persons or deceased relatives
- **Supernatural encounters:** Information gained relates to local supernatural history and entity behavior
- **1920s technology limitations:** No technological way to record or verify the whispers
- **Community dynamics:** Locals who've experienced this often become reclusive or "touched"

### Atmospheric Considerations
- **Building tension:** Whispers become more frequent as supernatural danger increases
- **Maintaining mystery:** Information is cryptic, metaphorical, or incomplete
- **Cultural authenticity:** Incorporate Cherokee spiritual concepts and mountain folklore

## Mechanical Details

### Cypher System Integration
- **Difficulty modifications:** 
  - Weak influence: Difficulty 6
  - Moderate influence: Difficulty 5  
  - Strong influence: Difficulty 4
  - Overwhelming influence: Difficulty 3
- **Asset/hindrance rules:** 
  - Connected artifacts provide Asset
  - Mental exhaustion provides Hindrance
- **GM intrusion opportunities:** Whispers provide false information or attract unwanted attention
- **Edge cases:** Characters with psychic sensitivity or supernatural backgrounds may have different difficulty ratings

### Related Rules
- **Reality Distortion:** Areas where whispers are audible often have unstable reality
- **Corruption Mechanics:** Repeated exposure to whispers accelerates supernatural corruption
- **Social Interaction:** NPCs react poorly to characters showing signs of "listening to voices"

### Conflicts & Clarifications
- **Overrides:** This rule supersedes normal investigation mechanics in supernatural areas
- **Exceptions:** Characters with specific supernatural protection may resist the mental cost
- **Edge cases:** Unconscious or sleeping characters may receive whispers as dreams
- **GM discretion points:** Information quality and mental cost can be adjusted based on story needs

## Session Applications
### Quick Reference Table
| Old Gods Influence | Difficulty | Mental Cost | Information Quality |
|-------------------|------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Weak | 6 | 1 point | Vague hints |
| Moderate | 5 | 2 points | Useful clues |
| Strong | 4 | 3 points | Specific details |
| Overwhelming | 3 | 4 points | Dangerous secrets |

### GM Tools
- **When to apply:** When characters need information but normal investigation has reached limits
- **When to ignore:** In completely mundane locations or situations
- **Scaling for drama:** Increase mental cost when characters are already stressed
- **Player agency considerations:** Always make this a player choice, never force whispers on characters

## Common Mistakes
### Player Misunderstandings
- **Common error:** Thinking whispers are always helpful or accurate
  **Correction:** Old Gods entities have their own agenda and may mislead

- **Common error:** Believing mental cost can be avoided through clever tactics
  **Correction:** The cost represents fundamental psychic intrusion that cannot be prevented

### GM Pitfalls
- **Avoid:** Making whispers a substitute for proper investigation and clues
  **Instead:** Use whispers to supplement investigation, not replace it

- **Avoid:** Providing crucial plot information only through whispers
  **Instead:** Ensure key information is available through multiple sources

## Playtesting Notes
### What Works Well
- Creates tension between gaining information and preserving mental health
- Provides atmospheric method for delivering supernatural lore
- Gives players active choice in how much supernatural risk to take

### What Needs Adjustment
- Balance mental cost to prevent overuse while keeping option viable
- Ensure information quality matches the risk taken
- Monitor cumulative effect on character mental health

### Player Feedback
- Players enjoy the risk/reward decision making
- Atmospheric descriptions of whispers add to horror elements
- Need clear guidelines on when whispers are available vs. not

## Related Content
### NPCs That Use This Rule
- Local "touched" individuals who've listened too long
- Cherokee elder who understands protective methods
- Professor Whitaker (before disappearance) - shows effects of overuse

### Locations Where It Applies
- Panther Creek (strong influence)
- The Cliff House (moderate influence at night)
- Any location with supernatural artifacts present
- Underground cave systems with Old Gods connections

### Sessions That Featured This Rule
- Session 2: First introduction when characters handle Strange Geological Samples
- Future sessions at high supernatural activity locations

## Designer Notes
### Intent
**Purpose:** Provide mechanism for supernatural information gathering that has meaningful cost
**Design goals:** Create player agency in supernatural exposure while maintaining horror atmosphere
**Inspiration:** Traditional Appalachian beliefs about "hearing things" and psychic sensitivity

### Balance Considerations
- **Power level:** Information gained should be valuable but not game-breaking
- **Complexity cost:** Simple enough to use frequently but complex enough to create meaningful decisions
- **Fun factor:** Risk/reward creates tension and player investment
- **Narrative support:** Reinforces themes of dangerous knowledge and supernatural corruption

## Variants & Options
### Simplified Version
- **When to use:** New players or when focusing on other game elements
- **How it works:** Fixed difficulty 5, fixed cost of 2 Intellect points, GM determines information quality

### Advanced Version
- **When to use:** Experienced players who want deeper supernatural mechanics
- **Additional complexity:** Different types of whispers (warning, luring, commanding) with different effects and costs

### Optional Additions
- Protective rituals that can reduce mental cost
- Character backgrounds that modify whisper effectiveness
- Long-term effects of repeated whisper exposure
