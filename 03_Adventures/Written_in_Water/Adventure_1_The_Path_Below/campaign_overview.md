# Written in Water; Adventure 1: The Path Below

## Overview

This is a two section Arc, easing the PC characters into the world of Old Gods of Appalachia and letting us all get comfortable as newbies in TTRPGs.

### pre-session planning:
- Plan the number of people and technology involved as some players live in separate states
- Learn Caracter Creation in Old/Gods Cypher System
- Once the party is finalized type a cute message on my typewriter that schedules a call with each player to help them set up their Character and explain the back story to help them include a connection to our Mr. Whitaker (still need to give him a better name or is it funnier to use an Adventures in Odyssey reference?)
- While setting up our PCs continue fleshing out the world with descriptions I can read from, as well as learn how to use FoundryVTT itself or if there is a better solution for my "world book"?
- Either way will need to spend more time in FoundryVTT to learn it 
- When I have enough and we can all meet we will do session 0. 


## Session 0
We meet, introductions if they are needed. converse out of game about characters to see if anyone had plans that they want to work out with another PC before the start (think long lost brother). Then we introduce the background before melding into the world. 

## A mysterious message. 
J. A. Whitaker has requested your presence for a dinner in the town of Tallulah Falls, Georgia. He has BIG news that you need to know. You find yourself on a train as it navigates sketchy trestles and heart stopping drops on your way to the Niagra of the South. I've planned for the train ride to start about 15mins outside of town right as its about to cross the notedly dangerous trestle over panther creek. This is where the PCs can opt to meet each other or, if during our discussion earlier, I can work with them being in town as the train scene can fade to black if nothing important happens, just gives a good entrance I think.  

Depot - players can meet with early arrival PCs and from here they make their way to the cliff house where we're going to assume they have been given rooms for a night or two by the professor to help compel them to come?

Cliff House - the Star of our show really. It will be where most of my planted clues and mysteries are. Need to think of some interesting "encounters" here as the Professor is missing, but assumed to be doing research as he'd been out early and back late most of his stay so the PCs will either assume he will turn up for dinner or they can try to find him but without a guide on idea of where the prof. goes. What ever happens this day the characters should all be back to the dinner where all will be revealed.

River Street Commercial District - the "common" side of town, this commercial part of the dichotic resort town rests in the shadow of a massive trestle flying above the rooftops of single story buildings. It's a marvel of human engineering. You'll find more laid back barbershops and music parlors in this part of town (it's prohibition in GA dontcha know). Should put an interesting character here if need be.

The Glenbrook Lodge - head under the trestle, toward Hickory Nut Mountain, if you turn up the gorgeously shady Norcup Lane, you would cross a stream and eventually break through the forest into the presence of  what can only be describe as a wooden, fairytale mansion. Its unique tower and gables is the most unique architecture seen in these parts. Home to the, exotic, Count Percy DeDebuney or Percy Hickox Norcup, or Dr. Percy Debuney... How ever he wants to be titled today. This man may be perfectly respectable, and not up to any harm, he sure knows how to get through a scrap. He still lives in the respectable cottage he built when he moved to the falls, but as it has grown up around him with an addition of even more rooms for boarding he has stepped out of the proprietorship, content to spend his days in comfort in the cool GA mountains. He has been promoting the water from area springs as a health aid. It has had wonderous effects on people, but there are some streams that should be avoided...

Outskirts and the Road north to Clayton - North-West, following River Street along the Tallulah River density rises up as single homes, and some boarding houses of hotel workers rise in a crowded district. 

Company town - If you ignore the bridge to continue to clayton and continue up River Street you eventually see a crowd of cabins, a general store that only takes scrip. This is the company town housing the workers who are eagerly awaiting to construct the tallulah falls dam. It has been held up as Helen Dortch Longstreet keeps finding ways to block it (This is pushing the history a lot but I want the 20s Old Gods setting so I think I can give Helen more money to keep the dam and towns destruction until later and leave it up to the players in this alternate appalachia). The men are restless, but also kept close eye on by the proprieter who will have them shot if they try to sneak off or back in during the night. He says it's discipline, but there's talk of men who'd gone missing after dark in the woods.
