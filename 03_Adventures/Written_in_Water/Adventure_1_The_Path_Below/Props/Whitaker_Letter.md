Dear _________ ,

I hope this letter reaches you without delay. Forgive the urgent and intrusive nature of my request, but I find myself in a situation that allows for neither patience nor protocol. I write to you because I know you, of all people, will understand.

Something has found me here. Or perhaps I have stumbled into it. I dare not commit the details to paper, for I fear the very words carry a danger I cannot yet comprehend.

Please, you must join me at the Cliff House in Tallulah Falls. I have procured accommodations for you, and we have a private reservation for dinner on the evening of your arrival. There is so much to discuss.

I've enclosed a train ticket. It will cover your journey from Atlanta via the Atlantic & Southern line, though if you are coming from more exotic climes, it will at least see you through the final leg of your journey.

Do come. The air is uniquely invigorating, and the water... the water is simply remarkable. You will see.

I must rely on your discretion.

Please come.

Dr. J. A. Whitaker
