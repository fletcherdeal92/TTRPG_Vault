# Cypher System Quick Reference

_For Old Gods of Appalachia_

## The Basic Roll

**Roll a d20. Beat the target number to succeed.**

- Easy tasks don't require a roll
- Target numbers are always multiples of 3

## Difficulty Scale

|Difficulty|Target Number|Examples|
|---|---|---|
|Simple (1)|3|Walking across a room|
|Standard (2)|6|Climbing a ladder|
|Demanding (3)|9|Picking a simple lock|
|Difficult (4)|12|Climbing a cliff|
|Challenging (5)|15|Disarming a bomb|
|Intimidating (6)|18|Convincing a hostile crowd|
|Formidable (7)|21|Surviving a lightning strike|
|Heroic (8)|24|Leaping across a chasm|
|Immortal (9)|27|Arm wrestling a giant|
|Impossible (10)|30|Moving a mountain|

## Your Character Has Three Stats

- **Might**: Physical strength, endurance, constitution
- **Speed**: Agility, dexterity, reflexes
- **Intellect**: Reasoning, memory, mental fortitude

Each stat has a **Pool** (your total points) and an **Edge** (reduces costs).

## Making Rolls Easier

**Assets** (being skilled, having the right tools, good circumstances):

- Each asset reduces difficulty by 1 step
- Maximum of 2 assets on any roll

**Effort** (spending points from your stat pools):

- Spend 3 points to reduce difficulty by 1 step (first level of effort)
- Spend 2 more points for each additional step
- Your Edge reduces the cost
- You can apply effort AFTER seeing your roll

## Cyphers

**One-use items** that provide special abilities or effects:

- Most characters can carry 2-3 cyphers safely
- Carrying too many causes problems
- Use them liberally - you'll find more!
- Examples: Healing injector, explosive device, temporary invisibility

## Recovery Rolls

**Rest to get your stat points back:**

- **1 Action**: Regain 1d6+1 points to one stat (once per hour)
- **10 Minutes**: Regain 1d6+1 points to one stat (once per 10 hours)
- **1 Hour**: Regain 1d6+1 points to all stats (once per day)
- **10 Hours**: Regain all points to all stats (once per day)

## Damage Track

When any stat pool reaches 0:

1. **Impaired**: All tasks are one step harder
2. **Debilitated**: All tasks are two steps harder
3. **Dead/Unconscious**: You're out of the story

## GM Intrusions

**The GM can complicate your life** by introducing problems, complications, or bad luck. When this happens:

- You get 2 XP immediately
- Give 1 XP to another player
- The GM can't make an intrusion if you just spent XP to avoid one
