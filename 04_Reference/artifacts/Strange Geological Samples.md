# Strange Geological Samples

A collection of rock and mineral specimens that Professor Whitaker collected from Panther Creek - samples that exhibit properties impossible according to conventional geology.

## Description
- **Physical appearance:** Six different rock specimens in labeled specimen boxes, ranging from ordinary-looking granite to stones with unsettling crystalline patterns
- **Size/weight:** Various sizes, largest about 4 inches across, total weight approximately 3 pounds
- **Materials:** Unknown mineral compositions that don't match any standard geological references
- **Condition:** Pristine condition, though some specimens seem to shift color in different lighting
- **Age:** Geologically ancient, but the crystalline formations appear to be actively growing

## History & Origin
- **Created when:** Formation predates human civilization, but active growth is recent
- **Created by:** Unknown geological processes influenced by supernatural forces
- **Original purpose:** Unknown - may be byproducts of Old Gods presence or intentional markers
- **How it came to this location:** Collected by Professor Whitaker from various sites near Panther Creek
- **Previous owners:** None - these were buried in creek bed and cave systems

## Discovery
- **Found where:** Whitaker's hotel room at the Cliff House, locked in personal safe
- **Found when:** Session 2 - during investigation of Whitaker's belongings
- **Found by:** Player characters after finding safe combination in research notes
- **Circumstances:** Carefully preserved and labeled by Whitaker with detailed collection notes
- **Initial reaction:** Immediately recognizable as something beyond normal geology

## Properties & Effects

### Mundane Properties
