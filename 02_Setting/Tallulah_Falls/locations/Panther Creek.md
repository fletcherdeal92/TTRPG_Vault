# Panther Creek

A seemingly pristine mountain creek that runs through deep forest before joining the Tallulah River - but locals know to avoid it, especially after dark.

## Description
- **Physical layout:** Winding creek through dense forest, several deep pools, treacherous railroad trestle crossing overhead
- **Atmosphere:** Unnaturally quiet during the day, sounds carry strangely, shadows move independently of light sources
- **Notable features:** Ancient trees with unusual bark patterns, creek water that reflects things that aren't there, perfect stillness even in wind
- **Local folklore:** Cherokee name translates to "where the hungry spirits drink", site of multiple disappearances

## History & Background
- **Founded/discovered:** Cherokee considered this a cursed place long before white settlement
- **Key events:** Railroad construction incidents, Samuel Hutchins' disappearance, failed attempts at bridge building
- **Old Gods influence:** One of the strongest concentration points in the region, active supernatural entities

## Current Situation (1920s)
- **Population:** None - even hunters and loggers avoid the area
- **Primary industry:** None - commercial ventures consistently fail
- **Leadership:** Unofficially "claimed" by unknown entities
- **Tensions/conflicts:** Railroad company wants to bridge it, locals actively sabotage attempts

## Supernatural Elements
- **Strange occurrences:** Time distortion, false reflections in water, voices calling from empty forest, impossible animal tracks
- **Local legends:** Spirits that mimic loved ones to lure victims, trees that move when not watched, water that shows visions of death
- **Warning signs:** Complete silence of normal forest sounds, temperature drops, overwhelming sense of dread

## Notable NPCs
*No permanent residents, but entities may appear as familiar faces*

## Artifacts & Items Found Here
*Items may appear here during supernatural encounters*

## Session History
*Sessions involving Panther Creek will appear here*

## Connected Locations
- **Roads/paths to:** Difficult trail from Tallulah Falls (2 hours), railroad trestle overhead (dangerous), old logging road (overgrown)
- **Travel time:** From Cliff House: 1.5 hours through dangerous terrain
- **Travel dangers:** Easy to become lost, supernatural entities, unstable ground, railroad trestle collapses

## Adventure Hooks
- Search for Samuel Hutchins (Elmer's brother) - what really happened to him
- Railroad company offering money for successful bridge survey
- Professor Whitaker's research notes mention "anomalous readings" here
- Local Cherokee elder might guide trustworthy individuals for protection ritual
- Strange lights seen from the trestle at night - what are they really?

## GM Notes
**Secrets:**
- Direct connection to Old Gods realm - portal disguised as deep pool
- Samuel Hutchins was transformed, not killed - still lurks in the area
- Railroad trestle was sabotaged by supernatural forces, not human
- Creek water has prophetic properties but drives drinkers mad
- Area serves as feeding ground for entities that consume fear and despair

**Foreshadowing:**
- Reflections in water show possible futures (usually involving death)
- Sounds of railroad construction that happened decades ago
- Voices of missing persons calling for help
- Trees arranged in patterns that hurt to look at directly

**Environmental Hazards:**
- Reality distortion - paths lead in circles, distance changes
- Time distortion - hours pass like minutes or vice versa
- Entity encounters - things that look like people but aren't
- Psychic assault - overwhelming fear and despair
- Physical danger - unstable ground, flash floods, venomous wildlife drawn to supernatural energy
