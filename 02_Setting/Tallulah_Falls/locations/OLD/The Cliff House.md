# The Cliff House

Perched dramatically on the granite cliffs overlooking Tallulah Gorge, the Cliff House serves as both hotel and gateway to the natural wonders of the area.

## Description
- **Physical layout:** Three-story wooden structure with wrap-around porches, built directly into the cliff face with stunning gorge views
- **Atmosphere:** Refined mountain elegance during the day, but shadows seem deeper than they should be at night
- **Notable features:** Observatory on the roof, extensive wine cellar carved into the cliff, private staircase down to the gorge
- **Local folklore:** Built on a site sacred to the Cherokee, guests report strange dreams and whispered voices

## History & Background
- **Founded/discovered:** Built in 1904 by railroad money, designed to attract wealthy tourists
- **Key events:** Several unexplained disappearances over the years, always attributed to "hiking accidents"
- **Old Gods influence:** The location amplifies psychic sensitivity and draws supernatural attention

## Current Situation (1920s)
- **Population:** 12 (staff and guests combined)
- **Primary industry:** Luxury hospitality for wealthy tourists and researchers
- **Leadership:** Mrs. Eleanor Thorne (proprietor), stern but efficient
- **Tensions/conflicts:** Locals are wary of the place, staff turnover is high, strange incidents covered up

## Supernatural Elements
- **Strange occurrences:** Guests report whispered voices at night, compasses spin wildly, photographs develop with unexplained shadows
- **Local legends:** Cherokee warnings about "the place where the earth speaks", spirits of missing hikers
- **Warning signs:** Temperature drops, feeling of being watched, animals avoid the area after dark
