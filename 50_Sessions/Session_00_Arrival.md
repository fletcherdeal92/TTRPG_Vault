# Cold Open
The Rabun Gap Route squeals as it rounds the bend above the gorge. Below, white water gnaws at dark stone. The conductor tips his hat: **“Tallulah Falls, end of the line.”**

# Hook
A letter from Professor Whitaker asked for haste. He has not met the train.

# Scene 1: The Depot & Veranda
- **Frame:** Elias steps onto the platform; the Cliff House verandas hum with late afternoon guests. The air tastes metallic—rain in the distance, or something older.
- **Choices:** Ask after Whit; survey the crowd; read the letter again; follow a tug toward the gorge.
- **Rolls:** Perception/Insight to read the room; Social to draw out nervous staff; Occult to feel the Hidden Current.

# Scene 2: Missing Professor
- **Clue Trail:** Porters saw Whit leave last night with a “dark-haired lady in a traveling dress.” They headed toward **Hawthorne’s Pool**.
- **Complication:** A sudden down-draft, smell like struck flint; lamps flicker though it’s still daylight.

# Scene 3: Threshold to the Pool
- **Frame:** A path descends into laurel and rock. Somewhere below, water speaks your name.
- **Intrusion Ideas:** Whispered bargains; a glint of antique brass lodged in shale; footprints that double back.

# Clocks
- **Whit’s Soul Displaced:** ☐ ☐ ☐ ☐

> “Thunder and his sisters were once warnings and wardens; memory is failing. The price is not cruelty but custody.”
