# Cold Open
The Rabun Gap Route squeals as it rounds the bend above the gorge. Below, white water gnaws at dark stone. The conductor tips his hat: **“Tallulah Falls, end of the line.”**

**Town Overview:**  
Standing on the train tracks facing north toward Rabun County, the Cliff House rises to your right, its verandas perched above the gorge. To your left sits the Tallulah Falls train station, its brick and timber frame bustling with porters and travelers. Behind the station and further left, a side street leads into the main drag of Tallulah Falls, where a trestle carries the tracks above rows of single-story shops and double-height resort buildings. Turning south within the town, a winding lane climbs steeply up Hickory Nut Mountain, eventually reaching the grand Glenbrook Hotel. The north rim of the gorge remains a sweep of verdant forest, broken only by the Clayton Road, which follows the Tallulah River after it crosses the water at the town’s northern edge.

# Hook
You’ve come to Tallulah Falls for your own reasons—rest, work, escape, or something left unsaid. Yet even before stepping off the train, you sense that the town has plans for you. The air is thick with secrets, and something unseen stirs beneath the surface, waiting for you to take your first step.

# Scene 1: The Depot & Veranda
- **Frame:** Elias steps onto the platform; the Cliff House verandas hum with late afternoon guests. The air tastes metallic—rain in the distance, or something older.
- **Choices:** Talk to locals on the platform; explore the station building; head toward the main drag beneath the trestle.
- **Rolls:** Perception/Insight to gauge the mood of the crowd; Social to engage with travelers and staff; Investigation to spot unusual details around the depot.

# Scene 2: First Signs of Mystery
- **Frame:** In the main drag beneath the trestle, the bustle of shops and resort buildings holds whispers and sideways glances. Something feels just out of sight.
- **Clue Trail:** Overheard rumors about strange lights near the river at night; a shopkeeper nervously hides a curious, antique trinket when approached.
- **Complication:** A sudden chill passes despite the warm afternoon; shadows seem to flicker unnaturally along the trestle supports.

# Scene 3: Paths Leading Out
- **Frame:** At the edge of town, the road forks: one path climbs steeply toward the Glenbrook Hotel on Hickory Nut Mountain; the other follows Clayton Road along the forested north rim of the gorge.
- **Choices:** Venture up the mountain road toward the hotel; follow Clayton Road into the dense forest.
- **Intrusion Ideas:** A distant, mournful call carried on the wind; an unsettling stillness among the trees; a weather-worn signpost with cryptic markings.

# GM Notes
> [!gm]
> Thunder is a well-known figure in the region’s folklore, and while not necessarily the central antagonist, he can be encountered if the players’ actions align with or provoke his presence. The primary mystery or threat in this story may be unrelated to Thunder, but crossing paths with him can lead to dramatic and significant consequences. Keep Thunder as a potential encounter that adds depth and tension to the unfolding events.
